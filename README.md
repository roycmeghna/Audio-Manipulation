# Audio-Manipulation
A project in MATLAB consisting of 3 audio processing techniques - Echo addition, Compression, Noise Reduction

hello_new.wav - Sample audio used. <br>
AudioCompression.m - This is the for audio compression. The code output consists of 3 compressed audio files.<br>
Echo.m - This is the code for echo addition. This can be used for convolution of 2 different audios as well. The output is a wav file consisting of the echo addition.<br>
NoiseRemoval.m - This is the code for noise removal.<br>
